# MyChatAlert

Alerts the player when designated keywords are found in specified chat channels

## Using this addon

Download it and install as a typical wow addon. Customization can be found in the interface/addons panel, and sounds can be browsed on [Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/sounds). Clicking on an author's name in the alert frame or printed alerts will open a whisper to that player.

To create an alert:

1) In the options, in the `channel` section, select a `channel` from the dropdown, or manually type in the name

2) After adding a channel, go to the `keyword` section and pick the `channel` you want to add an alert to

3) Type in the `keyword` that you want to be alerted for

4) If you have printed alerts enabled, you'll see them printed to the chat frame (or whichever frame you change it to), the minimap button gives access to the alert frame, which lists your last (up to 30) alerts

## Chat Commands

- `/mca` opens the addon options panel
- `/mca alerts` opens the alert frame
- `/mca ignore {player}` adds the player to the addon's ignore list
